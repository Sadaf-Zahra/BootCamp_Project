# Wholesale Data Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes the annual spending patterns of 440 wholesale buyers in Portugal across different regions (Lisbon, Oporto, Other) and sales channels (Hotel, Retail).  
The dataset covers six product categories: Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicatessen.

## What I Did

* Performed data cleaning & preprocessing (handling nulls, duplicates, outliers).

* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand spending patterns.

* Analyzed regional demand and category preferences.

* Explored cross-category relationships and correlations.

* Applied clustering to segment buyers based on spending.

* Derived insights on high vs low spenders and regional variations.
